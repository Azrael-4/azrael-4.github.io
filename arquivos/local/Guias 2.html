Martial Arts
- Martial Arts has been completely reworked and now functions the following way:
- Martial Arts has been reworked to cast the stage of the skill you are on when you attack with that skill so if a player has two charges they will use the second charge of that skill on attack and on the third attack they will use the third and reset back to 1. This converts the charge system to a "stage" system where your attacks are based on the amount of charges you have or the "stage" you are on and cycle from stages 1-3 and repeat. Finishers are no longer required however if you use one you will cast every stage of every charge you have generated. Charges are also universal so you can combo from stage 1 fists of fire into stage 2 blades of ice and finish with stage 3 cobra strike then begin a new combo string

–-
Uma boa estratégia é usar a Sorceress ou Druid ou Assassin e fazer Leaf, Stealth e Lore no early game.

Mais tarde substitui a Leaf por Spirit junto com Rhyme e a Stealth por Smoke. O Paladino de hammer é o mais beneficiado porque consegue usar Spirit no escudo já no level 25 (os outros devem encontrar um Monarch no Hell).

RUSH: fazer rush na minha opinião não vale a pena. Quando alguém rusha seu personagem, ele fica com level muito abaixo do que deveria, então quando ele matas monstros nos atos mais avançados, praticamente não ganha xp. Uma coisa que eu notei é que o TEMPO para subir de nível é basicamente o mesmo, ou seja. Tanto faz você fazer as missões certinho subindo de nível ou rushar o ato e depois ser obrigado a fazer run matando os mesmos monstros de novo e de novo... O único meio de ganhar mais xp que o normal é alterando o /players, o que só é viável no single player.


EQUIPAMENTOS SOCKET - SPELLCASTERS

- Spellcasters só precisam de exatamente 156 de Strength, que é o valor mínimo exigido para equipar o Monarch

- Sendo assim, para jogadores iniciantes que não tem o Monarch, o atributo Strength deve ser o menor possível pois assim economizamos pontos

- Além disso não adianta nada acumular Defense, pois sempre teremos a defesa baixa

- Assim, deixo aqui a lista dos melhores equipamentos para se usar as Runewords em duas tabelas, uma para baixo valor em Strength e outra com o teto em 156 strength

ARMA: uma Broad Sword [4] (mín 48stg) ou Crystal Sword[4] fazem a Spirit tranquilamente. São encontradas na Cow Level Normal.

ESCUDO: Monarch [4], Grim

CABEÇA: Shako
  
  
PROJECT DIABLO 2: dropar uma War Club[2] na Cow Level Nightmare e fazer a runeword Strength; dropar duas Legend Sword[branca ou 3] no Ato 1 Hell e fazer duas Blacks. Essa espada é boa porque é Elite e very fast attack speed
