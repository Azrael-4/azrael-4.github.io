    <tr><td colspan="3">Os pets funcionam como os feitiços de invocador e as runas do LoL.<br><br>Cada pet oferece uma habilidade ativa, uma condicional e uma passiva.</td></tr>
    <tr><th colspan="3">:: Iniciais ::</th></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Mystik.png"></td><td><b>Mystik</b><br><br>Mystik is perfect for your prototypical magic ability user. Mystik augments all Magic damage, and provides a useful harassment boost to the laning phase. Mystik does not offer any utility or defense however, so position carefully.</td><td><b>Inspiration</b><br>Activate: regenerate 93-135 mana over 0.5s (⏰105s).<br><br><b>Dive Bomb</b><br>When your abilities affect an enemy, Mystik deals up to 20-68 Pure Damage (scales with hero level & <span class="w3-text-orange">power</span>) (⏰16s).<br><br><b>Spell Mastery</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-blue">Magic Damage</b> by 6%.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Tortus.png"></td><td><b>Tortus</b><br><br>Tortus is focused solely on improving your hero's survivability. Tortus helps tanks, but really shines when paired with a traditionally fragile hero as it can surprise your enemies with the added health and healing.</td><td><b>Rejuvenate</b><br>Activate: regenerates 15% Max Health over 1s (⏰160s).<br><br><b>Harden</b><br>After being hit, blocks 50% of incoming basic attacks for 2s (⏰12s).<br><br><b>Vitality</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-green">Max Health</b> by 15%.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Pincer.png"></td><td><b>Pincer</b><br><br>Pincer is a versatile pet who helps you counter-act aggression. Pincer can break you out of CC, make you generally more durable, and make enemies think twice about harassing you in lane. Using Pincer's ability effectively can be tough, and the resistance bonus is best with more health.</td><td><b>Breakout</b><br>Activate: remove all stuns/slows and provide 50% stun/slow reduction for 2 seconds (⏰120s).<br><br><b>Retaliate</b><br>When an enemy attacks you, Pincer deals 30-100 Pure Damage (scales with hero level & <span class="w3-text-orange">power</span>) (⏰20s).<br><br><b>Defense</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-purple">Resistance</b> by 6-15.</td></tr>
    <tr><th colspan="3">:: 1ª Geração ::</th></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Bounder.png"></td><td><b>Bounder</b><br><br>Bounder excels at enhancing your hero's mobility. For the player who likes to kite, evade, or just move faster, Bounder is the ideal choice. Bounder enables you to fight on your terms, but provides little in toe-to-toe fights.</td><td><b>Slide</b><br>Activate: dash 500 distance in target direction (⏰100s).<br><br><b>Frostbite</b><br>When you attack, Bounder slows target by 20% for 3 seconds (⏰14s).<br><br><b>Quickness</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-light-blue">Movement Speed</b> by 4%.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Fitz.png"></td><td><b>Fitz</b><br><br>Fitz increases both the success rates and rewards for ganks, while granting out-of-combat movespeed to decrease downtime. However, Fitz's effectiveness is severely hindered if you are not able to successfully execute on gank attempts.</td><td><b>Shadow Stalk</b><br>Activate: deal 118-300 damage to target enemy hero over 3s and grant vision (⏰120s).<br><br><b>Bounty</b><br>Upon killing an enemy hero, gain <span class="w3-text-yellow">110 gold</span> (⏰55s).<br><br><b>On The Prowl</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-light-blue">Movement Speed</b> by 10% while out-of-combat.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Luster.png"></td><td><b>Luster</b><br><br>Luster is all about boosting your Gold Per Minute, enabling you to get more and shinier items. Luster is also an excellent choice if you struggle with last-hitting or plan on fighting neutral monsters. Beware: your higher GPM will make you worth more gold to enemies!</td><td><b>Blast</b><br>Activate: deal 700-1008 damage to target non-hero unit (⏰75s).<br><br><b>Greed is Good</b><br>If you miss a killing blow, Luster gets it for you (⏰15s).<br><br><b>Luster Touch</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-yellow">Gold Gain</b> from non-heroes by 3.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Razer.png"></td><td><b>Razer</b><br><br>Razer is an excellent choice for heroes revolving around their basic attack. It enhances offensive attack output while providing critical survivability to traditionally fragile heroes. Try using Razer's ability offensively by tricking enemies into thinking you're retreating.</td><td><b>Into the Shadows</b><br>Creates an illusion and applies stealth to your hero for 2.25s; Stealth breaks if the illusion dies (⏰110s).<br><br><b>Carnivorous Bite</b><br>Your next attack on a hero heals you for 26-96 Health (scales with hero level & <span class="w3-text-orange">power</span>)  (⏰14s).<br><br><b>Savagery</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-red">Attack Damage</b> by 2.7-9.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Topps.png"></td><td><b>Topps</b><br><br>Topps is an ideal choice for heroes who want to be in the middle of the action. Topps deals damage to nearby enemies, slows nearby enemies, and provides a boost in Power which should allow you to invest more gold into defense. Topps can make an imposing hero even more scary.</td><td><b>Tremble</b><br>Activate: slow nearby enemy heroes for 2.25 seconds (⏰120s).<br><br><b>Immolate</b><br>When an enemy comes in range, Topps deals up to 120 Pure Damage over 5 seconds (scales with hero level & <span class="w3-text-orange">power</span>) (⏰18s).<br><br><b>Unleashed</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-orange">Power</b> by 6 + 0.6 per level.</td></tr>
    <tr><th colspan="3">:: 2ª Geração ::</th></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Fiki.png"></td><td><b>Fiki</b><br><br>Fiki is the perfect choice for heroes that want to jungle or better handle creeps in lane. Fiki will jump in front of creeps and taunt them, will occasionally heal you when you are below 75% health and enables damage reduction from enemy creeps. Use Taunt to hold waves of creeps from pushing or to jungle without being attacked!</td><td><b>Taunt</b><br>Target an enemy unit to have Fiki taunt all nearby units for 15s (⏰90s).<br><br><b>Rejuvenate</b><br>When your hero is below 75% HP, heals by 55-125 (⏰40s).<br><br><b>Deflection</b><br>Blocks <b class="w3-text-light-green">Creep Damage</b> by 11-32.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Plunder.png"></td><td><b>Plunder</b><br><br>Plunder is great pet for heroes who like aggressively pushing lanes. Plunder grants a powerful buff to allied brawlers, occasionally gives you gold for attacking enemies, and provides you with a nice chunk of resistance. Try using Promote when enemies aren't there to defend.</td><td><b>Promote</b><br>Grants up to 5 allied brawlers +35% attackspeed, +75% base damage, and 300-1245 health (scales with hero level) for 15 seconds (⏰105s).<br><br><b>Pillage</b><br>Atacar um herói ou torre concede <span class="w3-text-yellow">20 gold</span> (⏰18s).<br><br><b>Resilience</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-purple">Resistance</b> by 5 + 1 per level.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Tink.png"></td><td><b>Tink</b><br><br>Tink is an ideal choice for heroes who need help defending towers or need to avoid getting locked down. Tink provides a powerful buff to allied towers, periodically reduces incoming stuns and slows, and provides increased out of combat regeneration. Heroes will think twice about trying to push down the lane you're in!</td><td><b>Enhance Defenses</b><br>Activate: Grant a friendly tower +50% damage, +100 resistance & +100% splash damage against enemy brawlers for 8 attacks. Kills earned by the tower will be credited to you (⏰115s).<br><br><b>Brace for Impact</b><br>When stunned or slowed, gain 50% stun/slow reduction for 3 seconds (⏰25s).<br><br><b>Augmented Repairs</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-green">Out-of-Combat Regeneration</b> by 3 Health & 1.5 Mana/sec.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="Zen.png"></td><td><b>Zen</b><br><br>Nenhuma descrição fornecida.</td><td><b>Knowledge</b><br>Target a position up to 3500 range to scout it. Gains vision & reveals enemies in a 700 AoE for 8 seconds (⏰35s).<br><br><b>Revitalize</b><br>Prevents you from losing Out-of-Combat Regeneration for 5 seconds the next time you enter combat (⏰12s).<br><br><b>Wisdom</b><br>Increases <b class="w3-text-white">Cooldown Reduction</b> by 13%.</td></tr>
